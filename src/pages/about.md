> Why hand made ?
> Because, hand made products are authentic and alive expression of an artist's creative craft.
>
>
> Mass production has resulted in tons of waste generation and I want my child to witness the world as I saw it when I was born, clean, non-toxic and less waste.
>
>
> Beauty in that which is temporary or imperfect. Things that come off of an assembly line, for example, are perfect, but things made by hand, like the glaze on a ceramic bowl, are imperfect. It is their imperfections that give them their beauty.
>
>
> The same is true for people. It is the combination of all of our imperfections that make us vulnerable, unique and beautiful. Let's make products come alive! #Atmanirbharbharat #karigar #kalatmak
